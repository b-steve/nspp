\title{Fitting a model to a Neyman-Scott point process}
\usage{
fit.ns_refclass(points, lims, R, disp = "gaussian",
  child.dist = list(child.expectation = function(x) x["child.par"],
  child.variance = function(x) x["child.par"], child.link = log),
  edge.correction = "pbc", siblings = NULL, trace = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A matrix containing locations of observed points,
where each row corresponds to a point and each column
corresponds to a dimension.}

\item{lims}{A matrix with two columns, corresponding to the upper
and lower limits of each dimension, respectively.}

\item{R}{Truncation distance for the difference process.}

\item{disp}{A character string, providing the distribution for the
dispersion of points around the parents. This can either be
\code{"gaussian"} for Gaussian dispersion, or \code{"matern"}
for uniform dispersion (giving a matern process).}

\item{child.dist}{An argument describing the distribution
generating the number of children per parent. It must be a list
with four components: (1) A component named
\code{child.expectation} that provides a function returning the
expectation of the distribution, with its only argument being
the single parameter to be estimated, (2) A component named
\code{child.variance} that provides a function returning the variance of a
distribution, with its only argument being the single parameter
to be estimated, and (3) A component named \code{child.link} providing the
link funcion for the parameter to be estimated.}

\item{edge.correction}{The method used for the correction of edge
effects. Either \code{"pbc"} for periodic boundary conditions,
or \code{"buffer"} for a buffer-zone correction.}

\item{siblings}{A named list, containing the following three
components: (1) A component named \code{matrix}, where the jth
element of the ith row is \code{TRUE} if the ith and jth
observed points are known siblings, \code{FALSE} if they are
known non-siblings, and \code{NA} if it is not known whether or
not they are siblings, (2) A component named pT, containing a
scalar providing the probability that the element (i, j) in the
component \code{matrix} is \code{TRUE}, conditional on the ith
and jth points being siblings, (3) A component named pF,
containing a scalar providing the probability that the element
(i, j) in the component \code{matrix} is \code{FALSE},
conditional on the ith and jth points not being
siblings. Defaults to an argument representing a Poisson
distribution.}

\item{trace}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, parameter values are printed
to the screen for each iteration of the optimisation procedure.}
